# Ballerina Library Package Owners

This document lists the owners of the Ballerina Library packages.

## Primary and Secondary Owners

Each package has a primary owner, who is responsible for managing and maintaining the package. Each package should have a secondary owner, who should assist the primary owner in managing and maintaining the package. In case the primary owner is unavailable, the secondary owner should be able to take over the responsibilities of the primary owner. It is assumed that the secondary owner would attend only to the urgent issues when the primary owner is available. The secondary owner should be able to take over the responsibilities of the primary owner only when the primary owner is unavailable for a long period of time.

## Responsibilities of a Package Owner

The responsibilities of a package owner include:

- Maintaining the stability and the quality of the package
- Checking the daily build status, Trivy scan results, load tests, and GraalVM checks
- Coming up with proposals to improve the package
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Responding to issues and add relevant labels
- Responding to questions in the Discord server
- Responding to internal and external queries and issues related to the package
- Handling individual releases and help release managers with the release process

When there is a change of ownership, the new owner should be responsible for updating this document.

>**Note:** When adding a new package, please add it according to the alphabetical order, disregarding the organization name.
