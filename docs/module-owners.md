# Ballerina Library Package Owners

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the owners of the Ballerina Library packages.

## Primary and Secondary Owners

### Primary Owner

The primary owner of a Ballerina Library package holds the core responsibility for managing and maintaining the package. Their tasks include overseeing the stability and quality of the package, monitoring essential metrics such as daily build status, Trivy scan results, load tests, and GraalVM checks. They are also responsible for evaluating proposals to enhance the package, reviewing and merging pull requests, addressing issues, and ensuring timely responses to inquiries on the Discord server. Furthermore, the primary owner manages individual releases and collaborates with release managers to facilitate the release process.

### Secondary Owner

The secondary owner of a Ballerina Library package plays a vital supportive role. In the absence of the primary owner, they assume responsibility for urgent matters and assist in managing and maintaining the package. While they may not handle the package's core duties on a regular basis, they should be prepared to take over the primary owner's responsibilities if the latter becomes unavailable for an extended period. The secondary owner's tasks include monitoring the package's status, assisting in reviewing pull requests, and promptly responding to urgent issues in collaboration with the primary owner.
